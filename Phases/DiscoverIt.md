Offensive phase

*MITRE ATT&CK Tactic:*  [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/)

*The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.*

After all students have built their respective servers, the coach will scan the network and formulate questions to put into CTFd.  

For example,

- What IP addresses have a MySQL database running on them?
- What version is the Apache webserver at this IP address?

All students will scan the address space with nmap to discover the hosts, services, and vulnerabilities.
- Students use their host discovery and port scan results to answer the questions in CTFd to gain points
- After 1 or 2 weeks, the phase ends and a winner is announced
